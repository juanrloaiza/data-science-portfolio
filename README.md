# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and hobby purposes. Presented mostly as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Table of contents

### Data analysis

* [MinCiencias](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/minciencias): Analysis of the state of research in Colombia using publicly available government data (in Spanish). Involves descriptive analysis using Pandas and data visualization using Seaborn.

* [My music tastes](my-music-tastes): Analysis of my music tastes using the Spotify Web API to get data on my favorite artists and compare it to popular hits. Includes getting the data from the API, analyizing using Pandas and SciPy, and training supervised learning models.

### Natural Language Processing

* [Latin American Philosophy Mining](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/latinamerican-philosophy-mining) (co-authored with [Miguel Gonz√°lez Duque](https://github.com/miguelgondu)): Topic modeling using data from an academic philosophy journal in Colombia. We scrape data from publicly available PDFs, do cleaning and preprocessing, and train an LDA model to analyze the history of different topics in philosophy publications.

* [SEP Text Mining](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/SEP_TextMining): Analysis using the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to do topic modeling and natural language processing.

* [Dissertation Analyses](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/dissertation-analyses): I analyzed my doctoral dissertation, finding patterns of common expression and citations using NLTK.

### Kaggle competitions

* [Disaster tweets competition](kaggle_competitions/nlp_disaster): Supervised learning challenge to classify tweets and identifying whether they refer to a real disaster or not. Involves using NLP preprocessing and analysis, supervised machine learning models, and training a neural network for binary classification.
